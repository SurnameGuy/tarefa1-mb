    <p>Hello, my name is SurnameGuy, I'm 19 years old and I'm here to learn stuff and put some stuff on practice.</p>

    <ul>

    <H1>What is HTTP?</H1>
    <p>Imagine a radio. A radio sends and recieves radiation, right? But, what the heck those radiation does? Nothing. They are absolutely meaningless.</p>
    <p>...or not: If you have a method to translate those radiation into information using an organized structure, so we have a PROTOCOL.</p>
    <p>On the internet, HTTP is the protocol that you use mainly to communicate between devices, like another protocols as HTTPS, ONION, BitTorrent, etc.</p>
